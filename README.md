As a part of our project for the web development class we decided to create a web application, specifically, a chat bot. It is an online bartender which we decided to call the MohitoMan. Our chat bot will contain a base with information about recipes for various alcoholic drinks. Our aim was to simplify the drinks preparation as much as possible. The only thing that the user has to do is to type their available ingredients into the box below, and MohitoMan will take care of the rest. We hope that our application will allow the user to save time, which they would usually waste on searching for recipes on multiple different websites.
